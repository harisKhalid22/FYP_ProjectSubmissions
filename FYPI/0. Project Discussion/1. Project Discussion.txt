Presentation Points:
- people are unable to distinguish the needy one.
- needy people don't know what to do and who to contact. 
	Accept / Reject - Under Verification (pending) (In Progress)	-	Admin approve karega user ko show nhi hoga jab tk approval nhi hoga.
		Example: Olx
	Running.	-	Status bar with %
	Completed.

While LSH performs:
- Target audience - needy person.
	No specific target audience exist.

- Uniqueness:	
	We got cases where Selanionly had list of categories and no cases for verification. 

The above tasks are:
- Performed by personal relatives or friends
	No one asked them because of ABASHMENT (شرمندگی)

- continuely donate karaingy log - cases hawalay kardain backend se verify karty raho ap unko
- Priority base, case to case	-	based on seasons

Donation Categories:
- Donation
- Sadhaka
- Zakath

University students -> Aysa nahi hai sirf in do seasons ki baat ho lekin focus in cheezon pe hoga.
